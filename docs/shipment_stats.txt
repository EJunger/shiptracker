Shipment statistics
===================

Garner is all about logistics. In this assignment we wanted to present a small snippet of the problems that we are solving for our partners on the daily basis.

Data below represents real shipment data for the shipment that originated from Shanghai, China and was received in Toronto, Canada.

The assignment is to write a simple command line application called "shipment_stats" that will load the data above from the file, performs calculations and
provides the following statistics based on the data above:
1. How many hours and minutes did the shipment take between pick up and delivery? Format: hh:mm
2. What is the total time that shipment spent in Asia, USA, Canada? Format: hh:mm
3. Which step in the shipment process took the longest time?

Output example:

$ shipment_stats.py (or .sh, .exe, etc)
Total shipment time: {hr}:{min}
Total time in Asia: {hr}:{min}
Total time in USA: {hr}:{min}
Total time in Canada: {hr}:{min}
Longest shipment step: from {some status} to {some status}

There are a few things to keep in mind before you begin:

Quality trumps speed! The point with this exercise it is not to race to a solution but to show us
the best code that you are capable of writing. We would expect this is something you would
work on in your spare time over a couple of days.

Do state your assumptions. If you feel there is something you cannot make a reasonable
assumption about then you can email me and I will get the answers to you.

Do provide automated tests where appropriate.

Feel free to use any programming language or IDE.

We are aware that you have to dedicate time to this kind of exercise and we fully appreciate your
being willing to do so. Our hope is that you will also get some enjoyment out of working on a
problem that does actually have some relevance to the real world. We look forward to reading
your response.
